 In fruit classification, CNNs can be trained on a dataset of fruit images, learning to recognize patterns and features that distinguish one fruit from another.
 Random Forest can be applied by extracting relevant features from fruit images and using them as input to train multiple decision trees. The ensemble nature of Random Forest helps improve robustness and accuracy.
 The general learning algorithm would involve the extraction of relevant features from fruit images and the training of a model to recognize patterns and make predictions based on these features.
